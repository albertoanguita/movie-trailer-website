# movie-trailer-website

This application corresponds to project 1 of the full stack web development nanodegree.

The application shows a simple website with some movies. Clicking on a movie opens a youtube trailer.

To execute the application, run the entertainment_center.py file in Python (tested in Pyton 2.7.9). 


## Files included in the project

- **media.py**: contains the definition of the Movie class, which stores all information related to movies
- **fresh_tomatoes.py**: contains the code to generate an html file from a list of movies (given by Udacity, some changes included by me to implement extra features)
- **entertainment_center.py**: contains the definition of the six movies appearing in the page, and the code to launch the application

## Additional features with respect to base requirements

Additional information has been included for each movie: *director* and *release year*. Both fields are displayed in the website, under the corresponding movie title.
